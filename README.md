# ml-model
Machine Learning Model for predicting age, gender, and personality of the user

# text
Import numpy, keras, tensrflow, nltk(optional), and set up python jupyter notebooks with traditional conda or pip install, in order to emulate my enviroment. You can also utilize Google Colab, it may be more convinient. All of the code performing above the baseline is within the working_model folder, all of the other code is a draft that could be impvoved on or is not good for the provided form of text data, such as doc2vec, which did not perfrom well on the given textual dataset. To run, follwo the format:
- [input directory with test dataset] - [output directory]
Working Models:
Logres over text with preprocessing and LIWC
BERT with simple NN
Ensemble
SVM (low accuracy)
